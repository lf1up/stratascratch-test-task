# Development test

## Goal
Create a list of solved questions using React and StrataScratch API.

## How to use API
1. Register on https://platform.stratascratch.com/
2. Login
3. Open developer console and run `console.log(localStorage.system_user_logged)`.
That is your Token that you need to put to every query as Authorization header in a format:

`Authorization: Token {your_token}`

## Retrieve questions
`
curl -X GET https://api.stratascratch.com/questions/\?page\=1\&page_size\=5\&module\=57 -H 'Authorization: Token {token}'
`

Accepts pagination parameters and module ID. Without page parameter returns all questions

Important fields for the task:
- id
- question_short
- is_correct_solution -- shows if authenticated user submitted correct solution. Can take values of:
    - null -- no attempts
    - false -- failed or incorrect attempt
    - true -- question solved by user.
NOTE: it does not return module_id.

## Retrieve modules
`
curl -X GET https://api.stratascratch.com/modules/ -H 'Authorization: Token {token}'
`
Important fields for the task:
- id
- name
Always returns a list with all educational modules.

## Create solution attempts
1. Open https://platform.stratascratch.com/#/practice-questions?module_id=56 (freemium module)
2. Open any question from that module
3. Submit some SQL code
4. Make sure to submit some correct solutions from a 'Solution' tab of a question

## Deliverables
1. React application that returns list of attempted questions with their solved / incorrect statuses
2. Every list entry must contain question short body `question_short` and solution status
3. List must be filterable by Module. There must be a select input with All educational modules
and list of solutions must be refreshed without page reloading with filtered questions
4. List must be filterable by correct / incorrect solution status
5. UI must be neat, well-aligned and easy to understand without instructions
